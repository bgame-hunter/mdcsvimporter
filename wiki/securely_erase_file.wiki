#summary Securely erase file after processing.

Many people use password to secure their Moneydance files. This provides decent security against prying eyes, both by people who have access to your computer, but even more important in case your computer is stolen.

In this case it is also prudent to remove all other traces of your finances. Most people do not know that files they download from their financial institutions contains a lot of sensitive information. Therefore it is advisable to discard these temporary files in a secure way, rather then simply moving them to trash, as trashed files can easily be recovered.

The effects of checking _Securely erase file after processing_ in the _Import_ dialog are as following:

  * If the import operation fails, file will not be touched.
  * If the import operation succeeds, the .csv file will be:
  # completely overwritten three times by value 255, then random values, then 0's
  # deleted from the system

This means that a securely erased file will not contain any usable information even if it can be un-deleted. So you should not select this option if you require the contents of this file after it has been imported.
